Simple RMI Implementation

Mayank Mohta (mmohta) and Yuchen Tian (yuchent)


For a simple  demo, use "make demo" command.
This command does the following:
1. Starts a RegistryServer. Any RMI server can bind remote objects and RMI client can lookup objects
2. Starts an RMIServer. It registers two remote objects of type GreetingGiver.
The GreetingGiver interface has following 3 methods:
	a. String giveGreeting(String name) : To demonstrate pass by value in RMI.
	b. RemoteObjectRef locateGreeter(String greeterName) : To demonstrate that RemoteObjectRef can be returned by Remote method calls
	c. String collectGreeting(String name, RemoteObjectRef) : This demonstrates that RemoteObjectRef can be passed as parameters thus enabling remote method calls to be chained
3. Starts an RMI Client: It does lookup for remote objects and demonstrates each of the methods of the GreetingGiver.

Please see the report for a detailed description of design.
